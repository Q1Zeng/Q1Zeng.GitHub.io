Hello! I'm Qi Zeng (曾祺), an 4th year undergraduate student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.
Welcome to my personal page!

I joined [Florian Schäfer's](https://f-t-s.github.io/) and [Spencer Bryngelson's](https://comp-physics.group/) research group on September 2021.
My research aim is improving Physics Informed Neural Networks ([PINNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics-informed_neural_networks)). 
Check out our work on [Competitive Physics Informed Neural Network](/projects/CPINN_project/).

I'm actively looking for an internship in data science related fields for summer 2023, my CV is available [here](/cv/).

Hello! I'm Qi Zeng 曾祺, an undergraduate student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.
Welcome to my personal page!

I am co-advised [Florian Schäfer](https://f-t-s.github.io/) and [Spencer Bryngelson](https://comp-physics.group/).

My contact information can be found with the icons at the bottom of the page.

<!-- I'm looking for an oppoturnity as  -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. -->

<!-- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. -->

<!-- Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. 
Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
